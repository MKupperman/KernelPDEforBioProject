    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = f(x(t)). $$\n",

    "Here, we are trying to discover the governing equation for the SIS model and compare to the 2-step kernel method. Right now, the architecture is just for ODE, but there are SINDy methods for PDEs. We also want to discover the forcing function. Since this is only dependent on time, time will need to be included as a state variable (the derivative part will just be a column of ones along with the other states). For sinusoidal forcing, the coefficient will be able to discover the amplitude, but the frequency is embedded with the time argument. The only way around this (I think) is to include multiple sin / cos functions with different frequencies.\n",
