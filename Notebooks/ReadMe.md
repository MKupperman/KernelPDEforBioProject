# Usage

The kernel bio code is intended to be used as a package!

Please install running the following command in the root directory:

NOTE that `setuptools` version 64.0 or above is required. The packaged dev environment is set up with the required version.

```bash
pip install .
```

For editable/development mode, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To work in jupyter notebooks, you may need to install `ipykernel`:

```bash
conda install ipykernel
```
